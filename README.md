# Auction-Marketplace

This is a basic hardhat template to get you started writing and compiling contract.
The template is configured with some sensible defaults but tries to stay minimal.
It comes with most sensible plugins already installed via the suggested `hardhat-toolbox`.

- [Hardhat](https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat): compile and run the smart contracts on a local development network
- [TypeChain](https://github.com/ethereum-ts/TypeChain): generate TypeScript types for smart contracts
- [Ethers](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/): renowned Ethereum library and wallet implementation

Use the template by clicking the "Use this template" button at the top of the page.

## Usage
